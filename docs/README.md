# Zamna Hawaii 2025 – Documentation

This folder collects operational documentation for **Zamna Hawaii 2025**, including

* Permit check‑lists with direct links to the original application PDFs.
* Ready‑to‑fill contract template stubs for common counterparties (artists, vendors, sponsors, etc.).

All files are provided in Markdown so they can be version‑controlled alongside the
codebase.  Always verify that external PDF links still resolve to the most recent
form before submitting an application – agencies occasionally update their
documents.

> **Tip** – When you eventually fill out a form or contract, **do not commit the
> completed document** back into the public repository.  Keep signed copies in a
> secure, access‑controlled location instead.
