## How to use this table

1. **Read the “When You Need It” column** and tick only the permits relevant to
   your production plan.
2. Create a Gantt or calendar that back‑calculates filing dates based on each
   agency’s typical processing lead time (listed on the individual forms).
3. Track statuses in the project management tool (e.g. Asana/Jira) – keep the
   permit number in the task title so it maps back to this checklist.
